# Halley Kart
A racing game. This project is experimental, please disregard for now.

## Requirements
As a rule of thumb: You shouldn't have to install anything for Halley Kart to work, and most hardware released after 2014 (and some before) should support it.

* CPU: x86-64
* OS: Linux
* Graphics: Vulkan 1.0 (most GPUs released ~2014+ and some earlier should support it)
* Audio:
  * Linux: ALSA (yes, you support it)
* Windowing Systems: Wayland

Some other platforms may work but are not tested or officially supported.

Support for other platforms, backends, and other stuff coming very soon.

I can only support the hardware that I actually personally own. If you'd like to help develop and/or test for other platforms (CPUs, OSes, or even consoles), I would love your help! Please let me know if you're interested.
